编译gd库时：

错误：error: fontconfig/fontconfig.h: No such file or directory

解决方法：
You're getting the wrong freetype...the one you installed in /usr/local is a newer version than comes with X11, and the auithors changed the requirements for how C programs are to use it. Nice, eh? Try using --with-freetype=/usr/X11R6 when you ./configure gd to (hopefully!) force it to see the correct (older) freetype that is usable as gd is using it.

错误：error: png.h: No such file or directory

解决方法：
vi gd_png.c
将
 #include “png.h”             
替换成：
 #include “/usr/local/libpng/include/png.h”
